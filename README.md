## ðŸ‘‹ About Me
Hi! Iâ€™m Max. Over the years, Iâ€™ve contributed to various think tanks, collaborating with companies both large and small to bring innovative apps to life. As someone who thrives on ideas, Iâ€™ve always enjoyed turning concepts into reality. Now, Iâ€™m channeling that experience into building my own creations.

## ðŸ”§ What Iâ€™m Building
I am currently working on a passion project simply called AirlineSim (Name in progress). Around 2010 I found a game called CyberAirlines, a game where you purchase hubs, buy airplanes, schedule flights and gain reputation in your area. I quickly became even more obsessed with airplanes than I already was. Just a few short years after I started playing CyberAirlines died and left a hole in my heart. I tried many other airline sims out there and while some were good, they didnt quite hit the spot.

The airline sim that I am working on takes the core pricipals of CyberAirlines and a few other basic sims, and merges them with new ideas, a new ui, and a new kind of fun. In my sim you will step into the role of an airline ceo/operations manager. The game UI is a desktop style interface with apps you can open close and scale, customize your desktop the way you want!

I would not call myself a GameDev, just a guy who wants to bring his dreams to life. The code is almost always broken, and buggy, tuning isnt quite right, but its playable and getting better every week.
